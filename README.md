# Excel photo uploader
This is a ready-made exe downloader for convenient work with large arrays and databases of photographs or pictures. The program creates a folder and downloads photographs into it using the specified links, numbering and signing it.
The first column can contain text names of photographs or product codes.
Thus, if column A1 contains the name "item", and columns B1, C1, D1 contain links to photographs, then the folder "item" will be created and the photos "item_1", ​​"item_2", "item_3" will be loaded into it.
You can download the release exe on the releases page or by following the link: https://github.com/ThreePerCento/Photo_downloader_from_links_to_Excel/releases
